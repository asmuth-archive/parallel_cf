parallel_cf
===========

parallel_cf computes a list of <itemA, itemB, similarity> tuples from a list of
<user, item> interactions using the [Jaccard similarity coefficient](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index).

#### Use cases:

+ __"Users that bought this product also bought..."__ from `user_id--bought-->product_id` pairs
+ __"Users that viewed this video also viewed..."__ from `user_id--viewed-->video_id` pairs
+ __"Users that like this venue also like..."__ from `user_id--likes-->venue_id` pairs


How it works
------------

Speaking more formally, parallel_cf implements item-based collaborative filtering
for implicit, binary ratings [1]. It takes as input data a list of so-called
"preference sets"; a preference set is a set of items that a user has implicitly
rated, for example by visiting, buying or clicking all of them. Here are a few
examples of what preference sets could look like:

```
# Example: Products clicked by user
[user23] product5 produt42 product17 ...
[user42] product8 produt16 product5 ...
...
```

From these preference sets we compute a two-dimensional array, the "co-concurrency matrix".
This array stores, for each unique combination of two items, the number of times
the respective combination of items has been observed in a preference set. We also
pre-compute another array storing the total number of times we've seen an item
as an optimization.

Using this index, we can compute the jaccard similarity between any two items
by simply doing a lookup into our pre-computed arrays (the set intersection and
union in jaccard can be transformed to arithmetic on counts retrieved from the
array).

The final step of the algorithm is to simply find the K nearest neighbors of each
item using the accelerated jaccard lookup.

Here is what the output looks like

```
# similar products based on co-concurrent buys
product5 => product17 (0.78), product8 (0.43), product42 (0.31)
product17 => product5 (0.36), product8 (0.21), product42 (0.18)

# similar videos based on co-concurrent views
video19 => video3 (0.93), video6 (0.56), video42 (0.34)
video42 => video19 (0.32), video3 (0.21), video6 (0.08)
```

#### Partitioning & Parallelization

The key to this implementation is that the item-item co-concurrency matrix is not
actually fully materialized in memory. Storing the full co-concurrency matrix
would require `O(n^2)` memory as the number of unique items in the dataset grows.

To still process large-ish datasets, we use a hash function to map the input item
ids into a number of buckets. We then scan the input data multiple times, once for
each bucket. On each pass, we build a sparse representation of the subset of
columns of the co-concurrency matrix that correspond to the item ids matching
the current bucket.

Another benefit of partitioning the co-concurrency matrix is that it allows us
to compute each of the individual partitions in parallel without requiring
inter-thread communication, hence the name parallel_cf.

_This code processes a real-world data set containing 16.2 million interactions
in around 8 minutes (6 batches, ~8GB ram, 24 cores)._


Example
-----

```scala
import scala.collection.immutable.ListMap
import com.paulasmuth.parallel_cf._

object ExampleRecommender {

  def main(args: Array[String]) : Unit = {

    val callback = (item_id: Int, neighbors: ListMap[Int, Double]) =>
        println("item_id", item_id, "neighbors", neighbors)

    // create a new cf processor
    val proc = new ParallelCF(callback)

    // read a csv file with headers, one line per order, columns: (user_id, item_id)
    (new CSVReader[Unit]((line: Map[Symbol, Int]) => {
      proc.import_rating(line('item_id), line('user_id))
    })).read("ratings.csv")

    // start the processing
    proc.process()

  }

}
```

You can run this example with:

    sbt run
